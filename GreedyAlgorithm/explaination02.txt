The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of jobs. For each job, there will be a pair of
positive integers i and j, where i < j, and i is the start time, and j is the end time.

A sample input is the following:
2
1
1 4
3
1 2
3 4
2 6

The sample input has two instances. The first instance has one job to schedule with a start time of 1
and an end time of 4. The second instance has 3 jobs.
For each instance, your program should output the number of intervals scheduled on a separate line.
Each output line should be terminated by a newline. The correct output to the sample input would be:
1
2
