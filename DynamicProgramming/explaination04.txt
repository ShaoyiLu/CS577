The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of jobs. For each job, there will be a trio of
positive integers i, j and k, where i < j, and i is the start time, j is the end time, and k is the weight.
A sample input is the following:
2
1
1 4 5
3
1 2 1
3 4 2
2 6 4

The sample input has two instances. The rst instance has one job to schedule with a start time of 1,
an end time of 4, and a weight of 5. The second instance has 3 jobs.
The objective of the problem is to determine a schedule of non-overlapping intervals with maximum
weight and to return this maximum weight. For each instance, your program should output the total
weight of the intervals scheduled on a separate line. Each output line should be terminated by exactly
one newline. The correct output to the sample input would be:
5
5
