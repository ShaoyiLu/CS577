The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of elements in the ranking. A sample input
is the following:
2
5
5 4 3 2 1
4
1 5 9 8

The sample input has two instances. The first instance has 5 elements and the second has 4. For each
instance, your program should output the number of inversions on a separate line. Each output line
should be terminated by a newline. The correct output to the sample input would be:
10
1
